        I heard a thousand blended notes,
        While in a grove I sate reclined,
        In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
        Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

        To her fair works did Nature link
        The human soul that through me ran;
        And much it grieved my heart to think
        What man has made of man.

        Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
        The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
        And ’tis my faith that every flower
        Enjoys the air it breathes.

        The birds around me hopped and played,
        Their thoughts I cannot measure:—
        But the least motion which they made
        It seemed a thrill of pleasure.
    </div>
    <div class="mar">
        The budding twigs spread out their fan,
        To catch the breezy air;
        And I must think, do all I can,
        That there was pleasure there.
