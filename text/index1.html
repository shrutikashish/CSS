            Nature refers to the interaction between the physical surasdkfbadsfjbasdlfjbasdljfbasdjlfasroundings around us and the life 
            within it
            like atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna, and humans.
            
            Nature is indeed 
            God’s precious gift to Earth. It is the primary source of all the basicnkkbsfkffabdfkajdbfaksdbfasldfasdkecessities         for the 
            nourishment of all living beings       on the Earth. Rigasdfjkabsd;fkjasdfkabsdfkajbsdfahsbdf;ahdbfjalsdfbalsdhfbasjdlfhht from the food we eat, the clothes we wear,
            and the house        we live in is provided by nature. Nature is called ‘Mother Nature’     because just like 
            our mother, she is always     nurturing us with all our needs.
