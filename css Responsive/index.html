        <p>"Lines Written in Early Spring" is English Romantic poet William 
        Wordsworth's meditation on the harmony of nature—and on humanity's 
        failure to follow nature's peaceful example. In the poem, written 
        in 1798 and published in Wordsworth's and Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads,
        a speaker reclines in a lovely grove on a spring morning. The joy he
        perceives in the natural world, and his belief that his own soul is
        somehow intimately connected to that joy, leads him to mourn "what 
        man has made of man"—in other words, the cruelty, selfishness, and
        fighting that characterize humanity. The poem argues that while
        humans are part of nature, they sure don't act like it.
